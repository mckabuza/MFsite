									<h2>14-Mar-2022: Breathe</h2>
									<p>	Breathe &#128067; &#128168;
										/briÀê√∞/
									</p>
									<p>
										As we enter a week of combat and meeting deadlines baby I want us to remember to take a moment to breathe.
										To take a step away from our electronics and screens, go outside, close our eyes and fill our lungs with mildly
										polutted city air, hold it for a few seconds and just exhale. Breathe. In that moment we will re-centre our 
										beings with nature, we will command our bodies to do exactly as we say and in turn command our lives. We will 
										project our goals and see them clearly. We will win for all it took was just a breath to mark our existence
										in this planet.
									</p>

									<p>
										I wish you a wonderful week my love. As we put one foot in front of the other. May we get closer to our 
										desired destination.

									<h2>07-Mar-2022: Women's week</h2>
									<p>	Shine &#10024; &#11088;
										/ Éa…™n/  
									</p>
									<p>Girls and women, they come in all sizes, shapes and characters, but there is one particular one that you 
									remind me of. Many wish to be this woman, she is not an easy woman to be, but you embody her seamlessly. 
									In times of apparent darkness, I want you to shine your light to the world, to the young girls like you
									who look up but do not see themselves, I want you to shine your light to show them that there is still room for them
									in this world and they need not succumb to the pressures and the pleasures of it all. Not just for women's week, but
									for life. Below I will quote a few words from a famous book that you should be familiar with, it
									is these words that remind me of you and the way you move. 
									</p> 
									<p>	"Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come.
										She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue.
										She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.
										Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all."
									</p>

									<p>
									I hope that you keep growing in this direction
									baby and that you keep influencing your sisters, your friends and your spectators by just being yourself
									and finding your place and purpose in this blue dot that we inhabit.
									</p>

									<h2>21-Feb-2022: Celebrate</h2>
									<p>	Celebrate üéä 
										/Ààs…õl…™bre…™t/ 
									</p>
									<p>
										Very so often baby we take our little wins for granted, even some big ones. As achievers we naturally strive and have high targets/ goals, and sometimes when good achievement comes we‚Äôre already looking on to the next. 
										The word of the week is ‚Äòcelebrate‚Äô because we have a lot to be grateful of and thankful for this week, that goes for both of us. How we celebrate is in whichever way that makes you happy, could me taking an entire day off to doing nothing or having icecream üç¶ mmhhh or doing whatever makes you happy. 
										I celebrate you entirely, for just the person you are. I am thankful and I am grateful. I am also learning how to celebrate myself for good work and not rush into smashing more targets, coz one may never live a fulfilling life if that is the case. 
										InshallahüëÄ, I trust that you will complete your touches in the week and we‚Äôll celebrate the dedication that led you through. We‚Äôll celebrate your hard work which sets the tone for much greater things. I understand the will to ‚Äòjust finish‚Äô may be hanging over you, and so carry the positivity of celebrating this little accomplishment carry you through. üéäü§óüåªü•≥üéâ

									<h2>07-Feb-2022: Propel</h2>
									<p>Okay Hi baby, our word of the week is *Propel* 

										Like propellers on an air craft or boat, they help *push forward*. The motion/ vision here is moving forward, as the object being propelled we need to use; as we mentioned 
										1. consistency 
										2. Determination 
										3. Self-drive 
										4. Curiosity 
										All to propel us forward and on to new unknown places where we can obtain growth, and maybe even exponential growth. Some paths may have some degrees of discomfort but only for a little while,  and even through that discomfort the aim is to propel ourselves forward. 
										
										We‚Äôve also got to help propel/push/ guide each other so we move forward, like a sheep dog nipping at the heels of his flock to keep them moving, with none slacking behind. 
										
										I know and trust that there‚Äôs every possibility in us to become something great, individually in our different spaces and together. What we need to do this week baby is to propel and let yourself be propelled üòä 
										
										Can I get an Amen? üëÄ
										</p>

									<h2>31-Jan-2022: Possibility</h2>
									<p>	So like uh I thought of a word for our week/day and today baby our word is *possibility* I‚Äôd like for you to carry this word with you in what you do, remember that quote ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a thousand possibilities within you.‚Äù Baby so many possibilities lie within us both, theres so much that we can do in our individual lines of work and even greater things together.
										Today I pray much light is shed on your path, that each article you read translates into inspired writing, the first step to bringing much greater possibilities  together. I pray for your absolute productivity. 
										I love you and you‚Äôve got my full support. 
										Now let us both in this day take the necessary steps towards a future we dream of sharing üåª
